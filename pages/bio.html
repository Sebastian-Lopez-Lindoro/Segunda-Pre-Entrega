                Tom Cardy (born 12 June 1994) is an Australian comedian, musician, songwriter, and actor. He became known in Australia for his "Song Sequels" segments on the radio station Triple J, and achieved more international recognition when he began posting his comedy songs (with accompanying videos) on TikTok
                Cardy has composed music for the comedy series The Feed and The Moth Effect. His debut EP, Artificial Intelligence (2021), peaked at No. 40 on the ARIA Albums Chart. He was shortlisted for the AACTA Award for Favourite Digital Content Creator and the Streamy Awards' Craft Award for Writing.
                He has two older sisters: Alex, a cinematographer, and Stephanie, a doctor. He and his sisters took piano and drum lessons during childhood at the behest of their parents, though he was the only one who opted to continue when their parents later gave them the option to stop. He studied music and psychology at the University of Sydney, then studied technical and further education to sharpen his music production skills.
                Cardy's style of musical comedy often incorporates elements of awkward humour, observational humour, and surreal humour.
